## Description
This is a quiz that cycles through questions. If the user gets a question wrong, time is deducted from the quiz's timer. If the user gets a question correct, they move on to the next question.

If all questions are answered correctly before time runs out, the user gets to enter their score. If the timer does run out before the user answers all of the questions correctly, the quiz is over.
